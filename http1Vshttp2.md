HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are both versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the foundation of communication between web browsers and servers. However, HTTP/2 offers significant improvements over its predecessor in terms of speed, efficiency, and user experience. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

**HTTP Version:**

* **HTTP/1.1:** Uses a single TCP connection per request. This means the browser has to wait for one request to finish before sending another, which can slow down page loading, especially for pages with many resources.
* **HTTP/2:** Enables **multiplexing**, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection. This eliminates the waiting time and allows for parallel fetching of resources, significantly improving performance.

**Header Compression:**

* **HTTP/1.1:** Headers, which contain information about the request and response, are sent uncompressed. This can lead to larger overhead, especially for repeated headers across multiple requests.
* **HTTP/2:** Uses HPACK to compress headers, reducing their size and improving efficiency. This lowers the amount of data transmitted and speeds up communication.

**Server Push:**

* **HTTP/1.1:** The server can only respond to requests initiated by the client (browser).
* **HTTP/2:** Allows the server to anticipate client requests and proactively push resources that it thinks the client might need. This can significantly reduce page load time by delivering essential elements before the browser even asks for them.

**Performance:**

* **HTTP/1.1:** Generally slower due to limitations like single connection and uncompressed headers.
* **HTTP/2:** Offers faster performance due to multiplexing, header compression, and server push. These features can noticeably improve website loading times and responsiveness.

**Security:**

* Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 can be used with HTTPS for secure communication. HTTPS encrypts communication between the browser and server, protecting sensitive data.

**In Summary:**

HTTP/2 is a major improvement over HTTP/1.1, providing a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly web browsing experience. By overcoming limitations of the older protocol, HTTP/2 enables websites to load quicker, reducing wait times and enhancing user satisfaction.
